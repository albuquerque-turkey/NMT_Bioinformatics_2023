Hello, my name is Joel, and I like snails

Hi everyone! My name is Sarah and I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Sciences.  Over the summer I helped make robots for the MechE department.  I am looking forwards to learning more about Bioinformatics because I really enjoy computer science and programming :)

I'm Anthony, generally I just go by Tony or AB. I am a third year PhD student in the Biotechnology program. I have a dog named Haku that is a boxer-terrier mix and I enjoy running!

Hello, my name is Annika and I'm a senior double majoring in Biology and Mathematics.
