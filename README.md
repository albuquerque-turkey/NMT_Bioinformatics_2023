Hello, my name is Joel, and I like snails

Hi everyone! My name is Sarah and I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Sciences.  Over the summer I helped make robots for the MechE department.  I am looking forwards to learning more about Bioinformatics because I really enjoy computer science and programming :)
